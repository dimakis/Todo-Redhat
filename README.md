# About the App

To run just git clone the repo. then change directory into the Todo-Redhat direcotry. Run 'npm install' and finally 'npm start' or 'npm start --p 3000' to start on port 3000.

The app uses the useState, useContext and useReducer react hooks to store global state. It's styled with Material UI. The Todos are then saved locally in the client browser. Full CRUD functionality is available with "striking-through" of a completed todo for that completed task feeling. The ability to add a new todo in the add-task bar. Edit of each task and deletion of todos is also fully functional.


On the plus side I have learned alot more about react and js in the process. Here are the main websites I used as references:
