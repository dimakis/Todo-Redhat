# About
I started out completely from scratch in this app, choosing Javascript and react, which are not what I'm most comfortable with. whilst I had basic CRUD capabilities I had never looked into the idea of persistance that didn't include a server. whilst i researched it I came across a really good article explaining the methodology of it. whilst trying to implement the local storage functionallity I had to double back and integrate much more of the code from the tutorial into my project than I would have liked. I'm quite sickened I didn't git commit my project as i would have rolled back to before my descicsion to try implenet the persistance and just given you that. I am actually extremely disappointed in what I am handing up. I thought I would be able to implement the persistance quickly and move on to the filtering of the tasks however I ended up spending way too much time just trying to get it back functional again. 

To run just clone the repo. then run 'npm install' and finally 'npm start'.

On the plus side I have learned alot more about react and js in the process. here are the websites i used as references:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
